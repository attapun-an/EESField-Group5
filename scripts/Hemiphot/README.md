# Hemiphot
Hemiphot.R is a script to calculate light indices and more from hemispherical images.
Please read the manual and helpfile to use this script.

Hemiphot.R is based on Hemiphot and Winphot, originally written in Pascal. The programmes have been widely used (over 300 cites) but became obsolete after Windows XP.

HemiphotTest.R provides examples of all single calculations. 
HemiphotBatch.R provides examples of batch calculations for a number of images in one directory
To be able to use Hemiphot.R you will need to install the functions with the command >source("Hemiphot.R") provided the script is found in your working directory
