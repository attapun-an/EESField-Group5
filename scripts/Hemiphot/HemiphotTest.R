# a script to calculate light indeces and more from hemispherical images
# read the manual and helfile to use this script.
# HemiphotTest.R provides examples of all single calculations
# HemiphotBatch.R provides examples of batch calculations for a 
# number of images in one directory
#
# to be able to use Hemophot.R yo will need to install the functions
# with the command >source("Hemiphot.R")
# provided the script is foudn in our working directory

### This is the test script for Hemiphot.R
### Here you can test the functions, set the parameters
### you will need to install the library jpeg 
### or any other library that can read images





### clear memory and 
rm(list = ls())


### set working directory
### need to change to your own settings!

##########          check RGB channels and choose         ##########

## We check the RGB channels 
## R (red) and B (blue) both have high absorption by leaves - leaves are black
## G (green) has high tranmission of light through leaves
## B gives high values for both white and blue sky
## B thus gives best contrast between sky (1) and leaves (0)

PlotHemiImage(im.hemi, draw.circle = T, channel = "G")
PlotHemiImage(im.hemi, draw.circle = T, channel = "B")


## We select the blue channel , as it has strong absorbance with leaves
## leaves will be almost black and sky will be almost white 
## under varying conditions (white and blue sky)

im.blue = SelectRGB(im.hemi, "B")

##########          Threshold the image of B channel for analysis         ##########

## We need to threshold the image
## a new image (image.th) is created that will be used for the subsequent analysis
## because the original image is kept (image), you can try various options

threshold = 0.55
image.th = ThresholdImage(image = im.blue, th = threshold, draw.image = T)

## Photosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPDF, umol m-1 s-1) P
